This is a 15 button USB midi controller based on Raspberry Pi Pico. I created this project because I wanted to be able to control my NeuralDSP guitar amp simulation software. 

The hardware design is based around Raspberry Pi Pico and 6mm tactile switches. The cost to manufacture the PCB should be less than 10 USD for a batch of 5 with shipping included. Raspberry Pi Pico is about 4 USD and the switches liteally cost about a cent each. The total cost of one controller should therefore be about 6 USD and change (micro USB cable not included). 

The software is based on CircuitPython and uses the Adafruit MIDI library.

For installation instructions see the README.txt file inside the firmware directory.
